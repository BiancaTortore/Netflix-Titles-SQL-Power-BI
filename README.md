# Netflix-Titles-SQL-Power-BI
This portfolio project cleans and models the Netflix Titles dataset using MySQL 8 views, then answers business questions with reusable SQL queries. The insights are visualized in a Power BI dashboard (PBIX included). The repo is fully reproducible: load the data, create the views, run the queries, and refresh the report.
